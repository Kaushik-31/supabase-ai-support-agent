Issue #198: Community Chat
URL: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/198
Labels: question
Status: closed
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
Does Supabase have any community chat server like Discord/Gitter/Slack etc?
Essentially a place where we can talk about the project and can have a real time discourse among the users?

We're patiently waiting for GitHub to give us access to [GitHub discussions](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions)..

We plan to center everything around our GitHub org. However, if you're already building a project with Supabase let us know and we can do a Shared Org on slack, or invite you into our internal slack as a guest

Thanks. Closing this item then. Right now I am just playing with hello world projects. If I feel I need more help and would need to get into the slack, i will drop a separate ping.

Nice one, thanks @rishavs . Let us know if you build anything cool - we'll release a showcase soon

We still need a real chat! It is important, especially during a beta period.
As users, we really need this easy talks to support the risk we are taking with a new born technology
