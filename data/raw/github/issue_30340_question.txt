Issue #30340: Building Supabase from code
URL: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/30340

================================================================================

PROBLEM:
It does not appear the documentation for Contribution is up to date for building Supabase. Has anyone performed a fresh VM install and build to ensure this builds without error. Likewise, what is the thought behind requiring SupabaseUrl for building the docs. 

https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md

Likewise, how many versions of node.js do you plan on being behind as well as deprecated packages. I hope someone is spot checking these packages in the product release cycle to ensure there are not security issues with the product product.

What problems did you encounter during the build process? 
I hope you can provide the error information and see if it can help you.

Hello @DarkNeedle,

We plan to support Node 20 as long as it is supported as an LTS release. 
As @zjy4fun said, did you come across a particular error? Attempting an install on a fresh machine is tested as part of the development workflow.
