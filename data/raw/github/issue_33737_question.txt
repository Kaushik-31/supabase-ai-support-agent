Issue #33737: SQLFluff
URL: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/33737
Labels: question, external-issue
Status: closed
================================================================================

PROBLEM:


This is by far the best SQL formatter I've tried (that works with VSCode). Since Supabase already includes linting suggestions in their documentation and AI prompts, why not release a recommended sqlfluff config which will let us easily auto-format our SQL files!

DISCUSSION/SOLUTIONS:

Hey, thanks for opening!
As Supabase is "just Postgres", there is not really any special config that would be needed for SQLFluff, you just need to specify the [dialect as postgres](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/reference/dialects.html#postgresql)

I know it's not needed, it will just be a nice to have. I know supabase mentions some formatting recommendations in the docs. Having the ability to auto-format to follow these would just be convenient.
