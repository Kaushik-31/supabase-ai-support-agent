1. what's the code of your function
2. What's your project id and your function name
3. Any logs you are seeing, both in your dev environment and your supabase dashboard?
4. What is the location that you're calling the function from?

@thorwebdev 

Intermittent Issues: We've been experiencing issues with Supabase Edge Functions that seem to occur intermittently, regardless of the user's physical location or network connectivity. This has led us to believe that the issue is not related to local network conditions.

Multiple Edge Functions Affected: While these issues are occurring, we have noticed that other Supabase APIs are functioning normally. However, it's not just one specific Edge Function that is experiencing issues. In fact, multiple Edge Functions are experiencing the same problems. This suggests that the issue may be related to Supabase infrastructure or platform-wide changes.

As a workaround to address the issue, we have decided to migrate and replace all Edge Functions. 

I previously reached out through the dashboard, but I didn't receive a response, Could you please check if you can find my previous message through the dashboard

I experience the same issue, some requests, around 10% just fail with this error, different locations, different functions, different time, it's especially painful to see that users cannot subscribe to premium because of it
