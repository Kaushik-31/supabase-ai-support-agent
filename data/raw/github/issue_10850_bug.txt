Issue #10850: Having e-mail auth provider enabled rate limiting other auth providers usage
URL: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/10850
Labels: bug
Status: closed
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
# Bug report

Having e-mail auth provider enabled gives a 429 rate limit exceeded, despite using only Phone auth provider.

## Describe the bug

We had e-mail auth provider and phone auth provider enabled. (With e-mail auth not being used.) Once we started getting a spike in traffic for our SMS OTPs, we started getting a 429 rate limit exceeded, despite Twilio looking fine on our end. Once we disabled e-mail auth as a provider, everything was working normally again. 

## To Reproduce

1. Enable e-mail and phone auth providers,
2. Try hitting rate limits that you would normally hit, but with phone SMSs,
3. Get a 429 - Rate Limit Exceeded.
4. Disable E-mail auth, and check that everything is working again.

## Expected behavior

Did not expect any rate limit issues.

## System information

- Browser: Chrome,
- Version of "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.1.1",
- Version of Node.js: [e.g. 16.13.1]

Hi  I´m dealing with same, but it only doesn´t work with certain e-mails for example I have two e-mails , for example, a@gmail.com and b@gmail.com, with a@gmail.com I have  429 rate limit exceeded, but with b not, why is the reason ?

--- Comment 3 by Ivaylo-Korakov ---
I am developing my app and I am getting rate limited no matter what email I use

--- Comment 4 by Axiom0599 ---
same problem. Whenever I hit the submit button, I get this error that says Email rate limit exceeded.
