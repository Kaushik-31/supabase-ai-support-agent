DISCUSSION/SOLUTIONS:

I have had the same problem. My app stopped working since last night. It shows a blank page when redirecting from google. However, when I use Firefox and open dev tools it works. it's so weird.

Possibly related. Or just a coincidence.

I have a same error
Not only google OAuth, but also another OAuth (kakao, apple, discord, google)
After OAuth process, it just return url, no return user authenticate data🥲

I agree with @mallahyari, works on Firefox but not Chrome, weird.

Not really up on this but... You mention works on Firefox and not Chrome.  Is it possible you were running on Chrome, upgraded, or got upgraded and then it stopped.  Then went to Firefox with the "new versions" or a clean slate?   Maybe some local storage/cookie thing from an old version to new?   Just speculating.
