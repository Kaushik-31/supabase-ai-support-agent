PROBLEM:
# Bug report

Currently we cannot get a direct connection to Postgres when using the supabase.com hosted service. The connection goes through Cloudflare which bottles requests and adds rate limiting etc. 

How to get access to direct DB connection?

DISCUSSION/SOLUTIONS:

--- Comment 1 by j-mendez ---
Looks like the way Supabase.com setups Postgres through Cloudflare and not s3. Do we have a place where the architecture is documented for more advanced usage?

@j-mendez The architecture is documented [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture), please let us know if anything needs clarifying.

Adding the [IPv4 addon](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) will give you a static IPv4 address to access your instance directly. Alternatively, as you noted, the direct connection string uses a subdomain generated from your project reference, you can add a [custom domain](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains) as well if needed.
