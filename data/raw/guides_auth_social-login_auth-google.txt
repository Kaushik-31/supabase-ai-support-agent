Title: Login with Google

================================================================================

Login with Google
Supabase Auth supports
Sign in with Google for the web
, native applications (
Android
,
macOS and iOS
), and
Chrome extensions
.
You can use Sign in with Google in two ways:
By writing application code
for the web, native applications or Chrome extensions
By using Google's pre-built solutions
such as
personalized sign-in buttons
,
One Tap
or
automatic sign-in
Prerequisites
#
You need to do some setup to get started with Sign in with Google:
Prepare a Google Cloud project. Go to the
Google Cloud Platform
and create a new project if necessary.
Use the
Google Auth Platform console
to register and set up your application's:
Audience
by configuring which Google users are allowed to sign in to your application.
Data Access (Scopes)
define what your application can do with your user's Google data and APIs, such as access profile information or more.
Branding
and
Verification
show a logo and name instead of the Supabase project ID in the consent screen, improving user retention. Brand verification may take a few business days.
Setup required scopes
#
Supabase Auth needs a few scopes granting access to profile data of your end users, which you have to configure in the
Data Access (Scopes)
screen:
openid
(add manually)
.../auth/userinfo.email
(added by default)
...auth/userinfo.profile
(added by default)
If you add more scopes, especially those on the sensitive or restricted list your application might be subject to verification which may take a long time.
Setup consent screen branding
#
It's strongly recommended you set up a custom domain and optionally verify your brand information with Google, as this makes phishing attempts easier to spot by your users.
Google's consent screen is shown to users when they sign in. Optionally configure one of the following to improve the appearance of the screen, increasing the perception of trust by your users:
Verify your application's brand (logo and name) by configuring it in the
Branding
section of the Google Auth Platform console. Brand verification is not automatic and may take a few business days.
Set up a
custom domain for your project
to present the user with a clear relationship to the website they clicked Sign in with Google on.
A good approach is to use
auth.example.com
or
api.example.com
, if your application is hosted on
example.com
.
If you don't set this up, users will see
<project-id>.supabase.co
which does not inspire trust and can make your application more susceptible to successful phishing attempts.
Project setup
#
To support Sign In with Google, you need to configure the Google provider for your Supabase project.
Web
Expo React Native
Flutter (iOS and Android)
Flutter (web, macOS, Windows, Linux)
Swift
Android (Kotlin)
Chrome Extensions
Regardless of whether you use application code or Google's pre-built solutions to implement the sign in flow, you need to configure your project by obtaining a Client ID and Client Secret in the
Clients
section of the Google Auth Platform console:
Create a new OAuth client ID
and choose
Web application
for the application type.
Under
Authorized JavaScript origins
add your application's URL. These should also be configured as the
Site URL or redirect configuration in your project
.
If your app is hosted on
https://example.com/app
add
https://example.com
.
Add
http://localhost:<port>
while developing locally. Remember to remove this when your application
goes into production
.
Under
Authorized redirect URIs
add your Supabase project's callback URL.
Access it from the
Google provider page on the Dashboard
.
For local development, use
http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback
.
Click
Create
and make sure you save the Client ID and Client Secret.
Add these values to the
Google provider page on the Dashboard
.
Local development
#
To use the Google provider in local development:
Add a new environment variable:
1
SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
Configure the provider in
supabase/config.toml
:
1
[
auth
.
external
.
google
]
2
enabled
=
true
3
client_id
=
"
<client-id>
"
4
secret
=
"
env(SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)
"
5
skip_nonce_check
=
false
If you have multiple client IDs, such as one for Web, iOS and Android, concatenate all of the client IDs with a comma but make sure the web's client ID is first in the list.
Using the management API
#
Use the
PATCH
/v1/projects/{ref}/config/auth
Management API endpoint
to configure the project's Auth settings programmatically. For configuring the Google provider send these options:
1
{
2
"
external_google_enabled
"
:
true
,
3
"
external_google_client_id
"
:
"
your-google-client-id
"
,
4
"
external_google_secret
"
:
"
your-google-client-secret
"
5
}
Signing users in
#
Web

Chrome Extensions
Application code
#
To use your own application code for the signin button, call the
signInWithOAuth
method (or the equivalent for your language).
Make sure you're using the right
supabase
client in the following code.
If you're not using Server-Side Rendering or cookie-based Auth, you can directly use the
createClient
from
@supabase/supabase-js
. If you're using Server-Side Rendering, see the
Server-Side Auth guide
for instructions on creating your Supabase client.
1
supabase
.
auth
.
signInWithOAuth
(
{
2
provider
:
'
google
'
,
3
}
)
For an implicit flow, that's all you need to do. The user will be taken to Google's consent screen, and finally redirected to your app with an access and refresh token pair representing their session.
For a PKCE flow, for example in Server-Side Auth, you need an extra step to handle the code exchange. When calling
signInWithOAuth
, provide a
redirectTo
URL which points to a callback route. This redirect URL should be added to your
redirect allow list
.
Client
Server
In the browser,
signInWithOAuth
automatically redirects to the OAuth provider's authentication endpoint, which then redirects to your endpoint.
1
await
supabase
.
auth
.
signInWithOAuth
(
{
2
provider
,
3
options
:
{
4
redirectTo
:
`
http://example.com/auth/callback
`
,
5
},
6
}
)
At the callback endpoint, handle the code exchange to save the user session.

33
return
NextResponse
.
redirect
(
`${
origin
}

`
)
34
}
After a successful code exchange, the user's session will be saved to cookies.
Saving Google tokens
#
The tokens saved by your application are the Supabase Auth tokens. Your app might additionally need the Google OAuth 2.0 tokens to access Google services on the user's behalf.
On initial login, you can extract the
provider_token
from the session and store it in a secure storage medium. The session is available in the returned data from
signInWithOAuth
(implicit flow) and
exchangeCodeForSession
(PKCE flow).
Google does not send out a refresh token by default, so you will need to pass parameters like these to
signInWithOAuth()
in order to extract the
provider_refresh_token
:
1
const
{
data
,
error
}
=
await
supabase
.
auth
.
signInWithOAuth
(
{
2
provider
:
'
google
'
,
3
options
:
{
4
queryParams
:
{
5
access_type
:
'
offline
'
,
6
prompt
:
'
consent
'
,
7
},
8
},
9
}
)
Google pre-built
#
Most web apps and websites can utilize Google's
personalized sign-in buttons
,
One Tap
or
automatic sign-in
for the best user experience.
Load the Google client library in your app by including the third-party script:
1
<
script
src
=
"
https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client
"
async
></
script
>
Use the
HTML Code Generator
to customize the look, feel, features and behavior of the Sign in with Google button.
Pick the
Swap to JavaScript callback
option, and input the name of your callback function. This function will receive a
CredentialResponse
when sign in completes.
To make your app compatible with Chrome's third-party-cookie phase-out, make sure to set
data-use_fedcm_for_prompt
to
true
.
Your final HTML code might look something like this:
1
<
div
2
id
=
"
g_id_onload
"
3
data-client_id
=
"
<
client ID>
"
4
data-context
=
"
signin
"
5
data-ux_mode
=
"

"
6
data-callback
=
"
handleSignInWithGoogle
"
7
data-nonce
=
""
8
data-auto_select
=
"
true
"
9
data-itp_support
=
"
true
"
10
data-use_fedcm_for_prompt
=
"
true
"
11
></
div
>
12
13
<
div
14
class
=
"
g_id_signin
"
15
data-type
=
"
standard
"
16
data-shape
=
"
pill
"
17
data-theme

"
18
data-text

"
19
data-size

"
20

"
21
></
div
>
Create a
handleSignInWithGoogle
function that takes the
CredentialResponse
and passes the included token to Supabase. The function needs to be available in the global scope for Google's code to find it.
1
async
function
handleSignInWithGoogle
(
response
)
{
2
const
{
data
,
error
}
=
await
supabase
.
auth
.
signInWithIdToken
(
{
3
provider
:
'
google
'
,
4
token
:
response
.
credential
,
5
}
)
6
}
(Optional)
Configure a nonce. The use of a nonce is recommended for extra security, but optional. The nonce should be generated randomly each time, and it must be provided in both the
data-nonce
attribute of the HTML code and the options of the callback function.
1
async
function
handleSignInWithGoogle
(
response
)
{
2
const
{
data
,
error
}
=
await
supabase
.
auth
.
signInWithIdToken
(
{
3
provider
:
'
google
'
,
4
token
:
response
.
credential
,
5
nonce
:
'
<NONCE>
'
,
6
}
)
7
}
Note that the nonce should be the same in both places, but because Supabase Auth expects the provider to hash it (SHA-256, hexadecimal representation), you need to provide a hashed version to Google and a non-hashed version to
signInWithIdToken
.
You can get both versions by using the in-built
crypto
library:
